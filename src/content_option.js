A graduate of NYU Tisch with specialized acting and directing training from LAMDA (London) and The Doon School, Aryan's artistic foundation spans both stage and screen. He has directed and performed in plays across New York, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and India, bringing together the rigor of Shakespearean theatre with the realism of modern film acting.",

    experience: "Aryan's work has received international acclaim, from the Tokyo International Film Festival to the World Film Carnival, Singapore, for its deep focus on performance and emotional truth. His stage productions have been lauded for their discipline and inventiveness, while his films are recognized for actor-centered storytelling and the fusion of mythic Indian philosophy with modern realism. As instructor at NYU and HIAL Film School, he mentors emerging performers and directors, helping them find authenticity through craft, intuition, and presence.",
    philosophy: "Aryan's teaching blends the precision of theatre training with the sensitivity of film direction.

He leads creative ventures like Relay Stories and Gitanjali Productions, both dedicated to nurturing original voices and meaningful performances that transcend medium and genre.",
